# Getting Started

This guide walks you through setup and your first workflow sync in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- An **n8n instance** (cloud or self-hosted)
- An **API key** from your n8n instance (Settings → API)

## Option A: VS Code Extension (Recommended)

The VS Code extension gives you the best experience: visual tree view, push/pull from the sidebar, split view with n8n canvas, and conflict resolution UI.

### 1. Install the Extension

1. Open VS Code (or Cursor)
2. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Search for **n8n-as-code**
4. Click **Install**

### 2. Connect to n8n

1. Click the **n8n** icon in the Activity Bar
2. Click **n8n: Configure** (or the gear icon)
3. Click **Add instance** if you want to save a new n8n environment in this workspace
4. Enter your **n8n host URL** (e.g. `https://your-instance.app.n8n.cloud`)
5. Enter your **API key**
6. Click **Load projects**, then select the one you want to sync
7. Click **Save and activate config**
8. The workspace can keep multiple saved instance configs; only one is active at a time
9. Click **Initialize n8n as code** to load the workspace

### 3. Sync Your First Workflow

1. The tree view shows all your workflows with status icons
2. Right-click a workflow → **Pull** to download it locally
3. Click the file to edit it
4. When done, right-click → **Push** to send changes back to n8n

That's it. Your workflows are now local files you can version with Git.

## Option B: CLI

If you prefer the terminal or need CI/CD integration.

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install -g n8nac
```

To update to the latest version later:

```bash
npm update -g n8nac
```

:::note Previous package name
The CLI was previously published as `@n8n-as-code/cli`, which is now deprecated. If you have it installed alongside `n8nac`, remove it to avoid command shadowing: `npm uninstall -g @n8n-as-code/cli`. See [Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting#cli-package-conflicts) for details.
:::

### 2. Connect and Initialize

```bash
n8nac init
```

The wizard asks for:
- **n8n host URL** — your n8n instance address
- **API key** — from n8n Settings → API  
- **Sync folder** — where to store workflow files (default: `workflows`)
- **Project** — which n8n project to sync

### 3. Sync Your First Workflow

```bash
# See all workflows and their status
n8nac list

# Pull a workflow locally
n8nac pull <workflowId>

# Edit the file with your editor of choice...

# Push changes back to n8n
n8nac push workflows/instance/project/my-workflow.workflow.ts
```

### 4. Let the agent carry the workflow to a real execution

Once a workflow is in n8n, `n8n-as-code` now supports the full runtime loop instead of stopping at “push succeeded”.

In practice, that means an agent can now:

- detect which credentials are still missing
- provision credentials after asking you only for the required secret values
- activate the workflow when it is ready
- inspect how the workflow should be tested
- execute webhook, chat, and form workflows on your behalf
- inspect the resulting execution directly from n8n when the run fails on the server

This is especially important for AI-assisted workflow development: the agent is no longer limited to editing workflow files. It can now help you reach a successful execution and debug real runtime failures using execution data returned by n8n.

If you want the exact commands for this loop, see the [CLI guide](/docs/usage/cli).

## Option C: AI Agent (Claude / OpenClaw)

Let an AI agent set up the workspace and manage workflows for you.

### Claude Code

```text
/plugin marketplace add EtienneLescot/n8n-as-code
/plugin install n8n-as-code@n8nac-marketplace
```

Then ask Claude:
> "Create a workflow that watches Typeform responses and sends them to Slack"

Claude handles initialization, node lookup, and sync automatically.

See the full [Claude Plugin guide](/docs/usage/claude-plugin).

### OpenClaw

```bash
openclaw plugins install @n8n-as-code/n8nac
openclaw n8nac:setup
openclaw gateway restart
```

Then ask OpenClaw to build or edit workflows in natural language.

See the full [OpenClaw Plugin guide](/docs/usage/openclaw).

## What Gets Created

After setup, your project looks like this:

```
your-project/
├── n8nac-config.json             # Saved instance configs + active selection (safe to commit)
├── AGENTS.md                     # AI agent instructions (auto-generated)
├── workflows/                    # Your workflow files
│   └── instance-name_user/       # Organized by instance
│       └── project-slug/
│           ├── my-workflow.workflow.ts
│           └── folder/
│               └── another.workflow.ts
└── .git/                         # Version control (recommended)
```

- **`n8nac-config.json`** — workspace config, saved instance configs, and active instance selection; safe to commit
- **API keys** — stored in your system credential store, never in the config file
- **`AGENTS.md`** — generated instructions for AI agents (regenerate with `n8nac update-ai`)

## The Sync Model

n8n-as-code uses an **explicit, git-like sync model**. Nothing syncs automatically.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `n8nac list` | Show all workflows with sync status |
| `n8nac pull <id>` | Download a workflow from n8n |
| `n8nac push <path>` | Upload a local workflow to n8n |
| `n8nac resolve <id>` | Resolve a conflict (keep local or remote) |
| Runtime provisioning & testing | Let the agent provision credentials, activate, test, and debug a workflow end-to-end |

If both sides changed since the last sync, `pull` or `push` will report a conflict. Use `resolve` to choose which version wins.
