# OpenClaw Plugin

The `@n8n-as-code/n8nac` package gives OpenClaw native access to the same `n8nac` workflow model used across the rest of the project.

It is the right entry point when you want OpenClaw to:

- bootstrap an n8n workspace for you
- carry the generated `AGENTS.md` context into prompts automatically
- run workflow operations through the shared `n8nac` CLI and tool surface

## What It Adds

Once installed, the plugin gives OpenClaw:

- an `n8nac` tool for setup, workflow sync, validation, and skills access
- saved instance config management through the same underlying `n8nac` commands
- an `openclaw n8nac:setup` wizard for host, API key, project selection, and active instance selection
- automatic prompt grounding from the generated `AGENTS.md`
- an OpenClaw-native workspace rooted at `~/.openclaw/n8nac/`

## Install

Install the published plugin package:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @n8n-as-code/n8nac
```

:::note Existing installs
If you previously installed `@n8n-as-code/openclaw-plugin`, uninstall the old package first and then install `@n8n-as-code/n8nac` so OpenClaw stores the plugin under the canonical `n8nac` ID without repeated mismatch warnings.
:::

Then run the setup wizard:

```bash
openclaw n8nac:setup
```

When setup completes, restart the gateway so the plugin and generated AI context are active:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Setup Flow

The setup wizard walks through the same core steps as the CLI:

1. Save the n8n host and API key through `n8nac init-auth`.
2. Select the active n8n project.
3. Generate `AGENTS.md` with `n8nac update-ai`.
4. Point OpenClaw at the initialized workspace in `~/.openclaw/n8nac/`.

Once the workspace exists, agents can also inspect and switch saved instance configs through the shared instance library instead of rewriting `n8nac-config.json` by hand.

After that, you can ask for workflow work in plain language, for example:

- `Create an n8n workflow that sends a Slack message when a GitHub issue is opened`
- `Pull workflow 42 and add retry handling before the HTTP Request node`
- `What operations does the Google Sheets node support?`

## Workspace Layout

The plugin keeps its working files under:

```text
~/.openclaw/n8nac/
  n8nac-config.json
  AGENTS.md
  workflows/
```

- `n8nac-config.json` stores saved instance configs and the active instance selection
- `AGENTS.md` contains the generated workflow instructions and schema-first guardrails
- `workflows/` holds the local `.workflow.ts` files you pull and edit

## Commands

### OpenClaw Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `openclaw n8nac:setup` | Interactive setup wizard |
| `openclaw n8nac:status` | Check workspace and connection state |
| `openclaw gateway restart` | Reload the plugin after setup or local changes |

### Underlying n8nac Flow

The plugin still uses the shared CLI model underneath:

```bash
npx --yes n8nac instance list --json
npx --yes n8nac instance select --instance-id <instanceId>
npx --yes n8nac instance delete --instance-id <instanceId> --yes
npx --yes n8nac list
npx --yes n8nac pull <workflow-id>
npx --yes n8nac push <file>
npx --yes n8nac update-ai
```

That keeps OpenClaw aligned with the CLI, VS Code extension, and Claude plugin instead of inventing a separate sync path.

## Troubleshooting

See the [OpenClaw section](/docs/troubleshooting#openclaw-plugin) in the Troubleshooting guide.

To reset the workspace and start over:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.openclaw/n8nac
openclaw n8nac:setup
openclaw gateway restart
```
